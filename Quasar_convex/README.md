In this project, we try to solve the minimisation problem of (strongly) Quasar convex functions using the Gaussian random zeroth-order oracles in both constrained and unconstrained settings.

In this folder, there are three Python notebook files. 
In the file "Links.ipynb" you can find the codes for general linear models test, hard function test, support vector machine test, and learning linear dynamical system test. 

In the file "RNN.ipynb", you can find the code for the recurrent neural network test.

In the file "RL_bandit.ipynb", you can find the code for the reinforcement learning test. 

These tests are part of numerical examples of a paper manuscript whose link will be announced in the near future.
